# Remove-Ambiguity

This code removes the left/right ambiguity in images generated by a phased line array using Lucas-Kanad / Horn-Schunck / SIFT flow method.
The idea is to detect/recognize/segment the mirror image using the higher flow field within the mirrored region compared to that in the real region.

1. run_remove_ambiguity.m is the wrapper that runs the code
2. remove_ambiguity.m is the main code for calculation
